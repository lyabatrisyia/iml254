        <p>This is my best friend from high school. We met in 2020 during the Form 4 orientation. We became a formidable team, competing against other groups. I felt incredibly grateful to be part of their group, even though I didn't know them well at the time. Most of them were top students at the school, with one being the top student every year. Being friends with them was a great blessing, as they understood the true meaning of friendship and never hesitated to help each other. I regarded them as siblings. In fact, after becoming friends with them, my performance improved, and I became one of the outstanding students in the school. Whenever one of us had a problem, we all tried to help and comfort them. I am thankful that this friendship has endured to this day.</p>

            <p>This is my friend from university. Together, we braved university life, which is vastly different from life after school. Despite the challenges, we remained strong in spirit to continue and achieve success at this university. We understood that being a student is not easy, as it comes with many responsibilities, but that is what makes us valuable individuals on this earth. I am immensely grateful to have met them in university. They provided me with the motivation and strength to keep going, and they were always there to help when I needed assistance. Their contributions cannot be repaid with just a 'thank you.'

                Our friendship blossomed through countless study sessions, late-night conversations, and shared meals in the campus cafeteria. We laughed together during our triumphs and supported each other through our struggles. Each moment spent with them was a testament to the enduring bond we forged. In their company, I found not only friends but a family away from home. They taught me resilience, compassion, and the true essence of camaraderie. Looking back, I realize that my university journey would have been incomplete without their unwavering support and companionship.

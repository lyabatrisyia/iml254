    <p>I studied at this school for seven years, starting from the age of five until twelve. This school is nestled in a village called Kampung Nangar, located in the district of Daro. My mother is a teacher at this school, renowned for her dedication, having taught there for over a decade. She was awarded for her excellence as a Malay language teacher. My mother is loved and respected by everyone, including the students, for her nurturing nature in educating them. As the saying goes, teachers are the parents of the students at school. Despite the school being in a village, it never hindered my quest for knowledge, as it provided all the necessary facilities for my education. One of my sweetest memories from this school was receiving the award for outstanding student in the UPSR science subject. I was speechless, never having imagined I would achieve an A in that subject.</p>

        <p>After completing my UPSR years, I continued my studies at SMK Agama Igan, Mukah. This school is also located in a rural area, yet it is well-equipped with various necessities for learning. Despite occasional water and electricity disruptions, my friends and I spent time together while waiting for the services to resume. We often shared stories of our lives, some sweet and some bitter. However, the past cannot be changed, so we let it be. Additionally, at this school, I earned numerous competition certificates, from school-level to external contests. Many activities were organized, and I seized every opportunity to participate. Among the competitions I joined were comic drawing, science and mathematics contests, IQ challenges, and many more. This school also enlightened me on the meaning of life. After weekly briefings and talks, I realized that life is not always beautiful. There will be ups and downs, sweetness and bitterness. However, what is important is to always be grateful for the blessings given and to accept every fate and decree in our lives. Life makes us better than before.</p>
